## Getting Started

Welcome to My Java world. I wrote this code in VS CODE
These are my assignments and projects when I entered college.
I apologize if there are errors, I'm still a beginner.ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources.
- 'Final_Project' and 'PBO' is different Project.
- in the near future i will make 2 'Final_Project' that have different Storage system.
  one uses CSV file locally the other uses Database(MySql).
